# Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

-  The **idea behind IAC** is that you write and execute code to *define*, *deploy*, *update*, and *destroy* your infrastructure

>  A key insight of DevOps is that you can manage almost *everything* in code
>  -  i.e., *servers*, *databases*, *networks*, *log files*, *application configuration*, *documentation*, *automated tests*, *deployment processes*, and so on.

## Five broad categories of IAC tools:
1.  **Ad hoc scripts**
2.  **Configuration management tools**
3.  **Server templating tools**
4.  **Orchestration tools**
5.  **Provisioning tools**
