#### Interplanetary File System (IPFS)

-  a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.
    -  (a distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another from any system.)
-  add an image file and the NFT's metadata to IFPS
    -  good fit for NFTs because of content addressing


#### Minting NFTs

-  Minting an NFT is how your digital art becomes a part of the **Ethereum blockchain**- a public ledger that is unchangeable and tamper-proof
-  Minting an NFT on a blockchain *mainnet* generally costs some amount of money
    -  writing onto the blockchain requires a fee(often called *gas*) to pay for computation and storage
-  **Lazy Minting** defers the cost of minting until the moment it's sold to its first buyer


#### Blockchain

-  The blockchain is a **decentralized distributed database** of immutable records
-  **Principle** on which blockchain technology is based on:
    -  it enables the information to be distributed among the users without being copied
-  **Platforms** for building blockchain based applications
    -  Bitcoin
    -  Ethereum
    -  etc.
-  A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography
    -  Each block contains a cryographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
            -  (generally represented as a hash tree / merkle tree)
-  **Four key features** of blockchain:
    -  Decentralized systems
    -  Distributed ledger
    -  Safer & secure ecosystem
    -  Minting
