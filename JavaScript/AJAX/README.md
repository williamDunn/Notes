## AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
-  AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.
-  AJAX is not a programming language
-  AJAX just uses a combination of:
    -  A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    -   JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

-  AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

With AJAX you can:
-  Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
-  Update a web page without reloading the page
-  Send data to a web server - in the background
