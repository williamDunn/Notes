### What is DevOps?

 - The bridge between Development and Operations
 - With the purpose of automating a project to ensure smooth code releases
 - Aimed at increased productivity and quality of product development

### What is a DevOps Engineer

-  someone who has an understanding of SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) and of automation tools for developing CI/CD pipelines.

## DevOps Tools

-  Version Control System tools. Eg.: git.
-  Continuous Integration tools. Eg.: Jenkins\
-  Continuous Testing tools. Eg.: Selenium
-  Configuration Management and Deployment tools. Eg.:Puppet, Chef, Ansible
-  Continuous Monitoring tool. Eg.: Nagios
-  Containerization tools. Eg.: Docker

-----------------------------------------

## Configuration Management

#### The Importance:
-  Automates time-consuming and tedious tasks
-  Also helps bring consistency and improvements in the product development process
  -  by means of design streamlining, extensive documentation, control, and change implementation during various phases/release of a project

#### What is it?
-  the process by which all environments hosting software are configured and maintained
-  Enables management of and changes to multiple systems

-  Configuration Management
  -  Configuration Identification
    -  Define the product and its configuration documentation id
  -  Change Management
    -  Control changes to a product and its configuration documentation
  -  Configuration Status Accounting
    -  Provide status and information about a product and its configuration documentation
  
  -  Configuration Audits

---------------------

## CI/CD
-  Continuous Integration / Continous Deployment

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
-  Integrating/Merging code into a shared repository, which is then validated by automated tests
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests 

##### Advantages:
-  Improvement in software quality
-  Allows Dev teams to detect and fix errors at initial stages
-  Less time in delivering features

#### Continuous Delivery (CD)
-  the tested code from continuous integration is automatically deployed in various environments by a manual trigger.

-----------------------

#### Packer
-  Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration

#### SSH
-  SSH stands for Secure Shell
  -  an administrative protocol that lets users have access and control the remote servers over the internet to work using the command line
  -  SSH also has a mechanism for remote user authentication, input communication between the client and the host, and sending the output back to the client.


#### Provisioning Defined
-  used when creating environments/resources and storage, an example phrase goes like this: "we need to provision a staging environment"

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintenance
