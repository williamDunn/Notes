## Bubble Sort
Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case

Memory: O(1)

-  In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater than the second
  -  Then we go onto the next pair, and so on
  -  In doing so, we the smaller items slowly "bubble" up to the beginning of the list

-----------------
## Selection Sort
Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case

Memory: O(1)

-  Simple, but inefficient
-  Find the smallest element using a linear scan and move it to the front (swapping it with the first element)
   -  Then, find the second smallest and move it, again doing a linear scan

-----------------
## Merge Sort
Runtime: O(n log(n)) Average and worst case

Memory: Depends

-  Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges them back together.
  -  Each half has the same sorting alogirthm applied to it.
  -  it's the merge part that does the heavy lifting
