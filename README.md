## Procedural programming & Object Oriented Programming

-  **Procedural programming** is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data
-  **Object-oriented programming** is about creating objects that contain both data and methods

----------------------------------

## Compiled vs Interpreted Language

**Compiled**
-  In this language, compilation errors prevent the code from compiling.
-  Types of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.

**Interpreted** (line by line)
-  In this languages, all the debugging occurs at run-time.
-  Interpreted language ranges – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

Programmer's (Quick) Checklist
------------------------------

*Preliminaries*

-  Do you have a solution (algorithm) for the problem you're solving?
-  How can you verify that your solution (and program) works? Good test cases?
-  Are there values that should be constants?


*Documentation/Source Code*

-  Insert required program header documentation clearing stating:
    -  Purpose of the program
    -  Author and date written
-  Identifiers
    -  Use descriptive names
    -  Class and Project names start with a capital letter (e.g., CashRegister)
    -  Variable and method names start with lower case (e.g., tax, total)
    -  CONSTANTS are the only identifiers that are ALL IN CAPS (e.g., TAX_RATE)
-  Eliminate all unused variables and "commented out" code used for testing
-  Is your code formatted consistently and in accordance to convention?
-  Are your comments clear and neccessary?


*Program Specific*

-  Is your I/O as specified? (e.g., your prompts, output formats etc.)?
-  Are there any specific requirements that need to be met?
