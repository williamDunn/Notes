-  Motivation
-  Structure
-  Code example

##### Benefits of knowing patterns
-  Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design
    -  Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teachs you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design
-  Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently
    -  You can say "use a Singleton for that" and everyone will understand the idea behind your suggestion
    -  No need to explain what a singleton is if you know the pattern and its name

##### Classification of Patterns
- Creational patterns
    -  provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
-  Structural patterns
    -  explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient
-  Behavioral patterns
    -  take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
