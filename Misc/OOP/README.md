# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

-  Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming

-  a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
      -  When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.


**Advantage of OOP** (over precedural progamming)

-  OOP is faster and easier to execute
-  OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
-  OOP reduces boilerplate code, and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
-  OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

-----------------------------------
There are **4 basic OOP concepts**:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


# Abstraction

-  Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user

* Simple things to represent complexity
    * Simple: objects, classes, variables, method(parameters)
    * Complexity: How a method is implemented, Calculations to perform to create a result

-  Calling a method, don't need to worry about the code in the method
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Encapsulation
* Keeping fields in a class private, then providing access to them via public methods
    * Why?
    * to re-use objects without allowing open acccess to the data system-wide

-  ie. Getters & Setters
-  Encapsulating our properties within the object by setting properties to private

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Inheritance
* Allows you to create new classes that share attributes and methods of existing classes

-  Code Reusability
-  Ability to add more functionality when needed through child class
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
    
# Polymorphism
* Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface (with it's own independent implementations)
    * Method overriding
         -  Overriding means 2 methods with the same method name and parameters
    * Method overloading
         -  Overloading occurs when 2 or more methods in one class have the same name but different parameters
