# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
-----------------------------------
There are 4 basic OOP concepts:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


What is: 
## Abstraction
* Simple things to represent complexity
    * Simple: objects, classes, variables, method(parameters)
    * Complexity: How a method is implemented, Calculations to perform to create a result

-  Calling a method, don't need to worry about the code in the method
    
    
What is: 
## Encapsulation
* Keeping fields in a class private, then providing access to them via public methods
    * Why?
    * to re-use objects without allowing open acccess to the data system-wide

-  ie. Getters & Setters
-  Encapsulating our properties within the object by setting properties to private


What is: 
## Inheritance
* Allows you to create new classes that share attributes and methods of existing classes

-  Code Reusability
-  Ability to add more functionality when needed through child class
    
    
What is: 
## Polymorphism
* Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface (with it's own independent implementations)
    * Method overriding
    -  Overriding means 2 methods with the same method name and parameters
    * Method overloading
    -  Overloading occurs when 2 or more methods in one class have the same name but different parameters
