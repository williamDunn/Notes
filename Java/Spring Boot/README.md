## Goals of Spring Boot
-  The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time. 

### What is Spring Boot

-  Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.

-  It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework. It is used to create a stand-alone Spring-based application that you can just run because it needs minimal Spring configuration.

-  In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.

-----------------------------------

### We should use Spring Boot Framework because:

-  The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
-  It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.
-  It simplifies integration with other Java frameworks like JPA/Hibernate ORM, Struts, etc.
-  It reduces the cost and development time of the application.

### Advantages of Spring Boot

-  It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be started using Java -jar.
-  It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc. We don't need to deploy WAR files.
-  It provides opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify our Maven configuration.
-  It provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
-  There is no requirement for XML configuration.
-  It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
-  It offers the number of plug-ins.
-  It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.
-  It increases productivity and reduces development time.

#### Spring Boot Features

-  Application events and listeners
-  Admin features
-  Externalized Configuration
-  Properties Files
-  YAML Support
-  Type-safe Configuration
-  Logging
-  Security

-------------------------------------------

-  According to the official Spring documentation, @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. @Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for more specific use cases, for example, in the persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively.

@Component
-  @Controller
    -  Presentation layer
    -  indicates that the class serves the role of a controller, and detects @RequestMapping annotations within the class
-  @Service
    -  Service layer
    -  indicates that the class holds business logic and calls methods in the repository layer
-  @Repository
    -  Data Access layer
    -  indicates that the class defines a data repository; its job is to catch platform-specific exceptions and re-throw them as one of Springâ€™s unified unchecked exceptions

#### Spring Boot REST Example

- The REST application follows the REST architectural approach. We use the REST application for developing and designing networked applications. It generates the HTTP request that performs CRUD operations on the data. Usually, it returns data in JSON or XML format.
