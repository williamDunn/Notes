## Goals of Spring Boot
-  The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time. 

### What is Spring Boot

-  Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.

-  It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework. It is used to create a stand-alone Spring-based application that you can just run because it needs minimal Spring configuration.

-  In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.

### We should use Spring Boot Framework because:

-  The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
-  It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.
-  It simplifies integration with other Java frameworks like JPA/Hibernate ORM, Struts, etc.
-  It reduces the cost and development time of the application.
