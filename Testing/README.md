## Testing

-  Testing is the process of executing a program with the aim of finding errors. To make our software perform well it should be error-free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the errors from the software.

### Types of Testing

### Unit Testing
-  Unit Tests will test small units of work in your code
    -  This would normally be testing a single public method in a public class
       -  Any external classes your method used should be mocked within the test

Where should the test be located?

-  src/main/java - for Java classes
-  src/test/java - for test classes
