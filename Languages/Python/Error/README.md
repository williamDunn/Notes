### Two common errors writing Python
-  SyntaxError
-  NameError

**SyntaxError**
-  something wrong with the way your program is written
  -  punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a *SyntaxError*

**NameError**
-  when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize
  -  Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a *NameError*

**TypeError**
-  when an operation is applied to a variable of an inappropriate type
  -  i.e.
```python
piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25
```

**LogicError**
-  Errors found by the programmer when the program isnâ€™t doing what it is intending to do.
