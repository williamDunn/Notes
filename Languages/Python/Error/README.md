### Two common errors writing Python
-  SyntaxError
-  NameError

**SyntaxError**
-  something wrong with the way your program is written
  -  punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a *SyntaxError*

**NameError**
-  when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize
  -  Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a *NameError*
